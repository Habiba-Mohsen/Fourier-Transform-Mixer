# FourierBlend Studio

FourierBlend Studio is a powerful desktop application designed for image mixing and signal visualization. This comprehensive tool allows users to explore the intricate relationship between magnitude and phase/real and imaginary components within Fourier Transforms, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for both beginners and professionals.

## Features

- **Images Viewers:** Open, view, and browse through four grayscale images with ease by double clicking on its viewer. 

- **Dual Displays:** Each image features dual displays showcasing Fourier Transform Magnitude, Phase, Real, and Imaginary components for in-depth signal analysis.

- **Output Ports:** Two output viewports displaying mixer results, offering control over the display location of the mixer result.

- **Brightness/Contrast Control:** Adjust image brightness and contrast dynamically using mouse gestures (via mouse-dragging left/right).

- **Components Mixer:** Customize Fourier Transform weights for each image through intuitive sliders, achieving a weighted average of input images.

- **Regions Mixer:** Define regions for each Fourier Transform component, choosing between inner (low frequencies) and outer (high frequencies) regions. Tailor region sizes via sliders.

- **Real-time Mixing:** Experience instantanteous responsive mixing.
